# Video Engagement Analysis of YT Video Title and Thumbnail

## Project Description

This project involves data gathering, augmentation, and analysis. The workflow is divided into three main stages:

1. **Data Fetching**: The initial data collection and preprocessing.
2. **Data Augmentation**: Enhancing the gathered data for improved analysis.
3. **Final Analysis**: Comprehensive data analysis and result generation.

## Files in This Repository

1. **data_fetching_01.ipynb**: A Python notebook (Google Colab) used for fetching and initial preprocessing of the data.
2. **data_augmentation_02.ipynb**: A Python notebook (Google Colab) used for augmenting the fetched data to enhance its quality and utility.
3. **data_analysis_03.R**: An R script used for the final analysis of the augmented data, generating the final insights and results.
4. **data_analysis_03.R**: An R scr

## Getting Started
