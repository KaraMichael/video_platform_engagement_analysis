"Why the Major League of Monster Trucks Failed...","3osyQ4Tl_o4","UCN9bzNWgwvjHq8JKx4kpftw","Monster Docs: Episode Two
Many people consider the Major League of Monster Trucks to be the best monster truck tour of all time. Despite its massive popularity, the series only lasted for one season. The MLMT was poised to compete with Monster Jam, NASCAR, and other forms of professional motorsport racing, but was never truly able to give their competition a run for their money. This is the story of how the MLMT rose and fell in under a year.

NXIVM (pronounced Nexium) was a self-help group that ultimately became an abusive cult. Its leader, Keith Raniere, has been sentenced to 120 years in prison and five months of probation for his crimes, including sexual abuse and sex trafficking. NXIVM started out as a program to help individuals achieve more in their personal and professional lives, but over time it became something much darker, with Raniere using the organization to fulfill his own narcissistic and sociopathic desires and to manipulate and exploit people for his own gain.

Sarah Edmondson and Anthony ‚ÄúNippy‚Äù Ames were both members of NXIVM, with Sarah serving as a high-level teacher within the organization and both witnessing firsthand the transformation of NXIVM into a malicious cult. They eventually became whistleblowers, helping to expose the illegal activities of the group and contributing to its downfall. Together, they currently host the podcast A Little Bit Culty, The story of NXIVM was featured in the HBO documentary seriesThe Vow, and in Sarah‚Äôs memoir, Scarred: The True Story of How I Escaped NXIVM, the Cult That Bound My Life. In this two-part episode, Sarah and Nippy share their ordeal ‚Äî how they managed to get tangled up in NXIVM‚Äôs transformation into a cult, what prompted them to escape from its clutches, and how they‚Äôre dealing with the aftermath of the experience. Listen, learn, and enjoy!

The National Skills Qualifications Framework (NSQF) is a competency-based framework that organizes all qualifications according to a series of levels of knowledge, skills and aptitude. These levels, graded from one to ten, are defined in terms of learning outcomes which the learner must possess regardless of whether they are obtained through formal, non-formal or informal learning. NSQF in India was notified on 27th December 2013. All other frameworks, including the NVEQF (National Vocational Educational Qualification Framework) released by the Ministry of HRD, stand superseded by the NSQF.


Under NSQF, the learner can acquire the certification for competency needed at any level through formal, non-formal or informal learning. In that sense, the NSQF is a quality assurance framework. Presently, more than 100 countries have, or are in the process of developing national qualification frameworks.


The NSQF is anchored at the National Skill Development Agency (NSDA) and is being implemented through the National Skills Qualifications Committee (NSQC) which comprises of all key stakeholders. The NSQC's functions amongst others include approving NOSs/QPs, approving accreditation norms, prescribing guidelines to address the needs of disadvantages sections, reviewing inter-agency disputes and alignment of NSQF with international qualification frameworks.


Specific outcomes expected from implementation of NSQF are:


 Mobility between vocational and general education by alignment of degrees with NSQF


 Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL), allowing transition from non-formal to organized job market


 Standardized, consistent, nationally acceptable outcomes of training across the country through a national quality assurance framework


 Global mobility of skilled workforce from India, through international equivalence of NSQF


 Mapping of progression pathways within sectors and cross-sectors


 Mapping of progression pathways within sectors and cross-sectors

Oh I found you

The storm is over 
You made it stop 
I‚Äôve come to find 
You‚Äôre what I want 
So laugh about it 
My tears are dry 
No doubt about it 
I‚Äôll be alright 
Past behind me 
I‚Äôm letting go 
And all I know 

It‚Äôs gonna be better
It‚Äôs gonna be better
As long as we‚Äôre together 
It‚Äôs gonna be better

As long as we‚Äôre together

It‚Äôs gonna be better now 

I see the future
It‚Äôs looking bright

Like paradise
The world looks different 
Inside your eyes
What I was missing
Is here tonight
So I laugh about it
My tears are dry
No doubt about it
I‚Äôll be alright
My past behind me
I‚Äôm letting go
And all I know now 

It‚Äôs gonna be better
It‚Äôs gonna be better

As long as we‚Äôre together

"How To Delete Search History on YouTube App (Newest Update)","toBFL3-03I4","UCIsPTUntUX2jzGuRXgkBi6A","In today's quick tutorial I show you how to delete search history on YouTube app as well as delete YouTube history and finally YouTube search history.  This is actually the second video I made on how to delete your search history or delete your watch history on the YouTube app.

Unfortunately, YouTube updates the app quite frequently and moves things around.  So the steps in my previous video are no longer valid.  However, I wanted to release this new updated video to show you where they moved the history & privacy option to delete your search history in the YouTube app.  You can also have the option to pause search history or pause watch history.

Well everyone, I hope you enjoyed today's quick video on how to delete search history on YouTube app.  If you found this video helpful, please consider giving it a like, feel free to comment (I respond to all comments) and subscribe for more future informative videos.

Lyrics: 
I could imagine you breaking my heart 
Those things can happen
Whenever you hold on too hard
I‚Äôm not a pessimist I‚Äôm just a mess in the dark

Tend to get anxious when something begins
‚Äòcause I know chances of staying together are slim
The odds are against us but I‚Äôll make the best of whatever this is

Oh ooh
Tired of writing in pencil I‚Äôm inkin‚Äô you in 
Ooh
Living like I‚Äôm not afraid of end

Afraid of the end
Afraid of the end
If and or when
Can we just pretend we‚Äôre not afraid of the end

What if you met someone else at your work?
Someone more stable and better at putting you first
You could lose patience while I‚Äôm on the other side of the earth

Oh ooh
Tired of writing in pencil I‚Äôm inkin‚Äô you in 
Ooh
Living like I‚Äôm not afraid of end
 
Afraid of the end
Afraid of the end
If and or when
Can we just pretend we‚Äôre not afraid of the end

Oh ooh
Oh ooh
If and or when
Can we just pretend we‚Äôre not afraid of the end

I could imagine you breaking my heart
I could imagine you breaking my heart
It might not happen but there‚Äôs still a chance 
I can imagine
I can imagine

"Testing Nvidia Broadcast Eye Contact ‚Äî It's Terrifying and Hilarious, All at Once!","YgR8yU-Ox9w","UCh6peLKpKn7o8BA6xRT9uUQ","Nvidia Broadcast recently added the much discussed Eye Contact feature, in beta, to the latest version of the software. The idea is that you can look somewhere besides directly at the camera, and AI-driven processing will correct your video feed to make it look like you're still maintaining eye contact. Mostly. This is going to be a short video with me talking, with and without Eye Contact enabled. I'll probably chat about GPUs, prices, and such but that's not the main point. And if you laugh, that's all part of the fun.

Sound off in the comments. Do you like the Eye Contact effect here, or do you think it's awful? I wish I had a good way to show the pre- and post-processing video side by side, so you can get a better idea of what's actually being changed. A couple key segments if you just want to see Eye Contact in action:

1:05 ‚Äî I'm looking straight at the camera for a moment and then looking to the top-right, then about half-way between the top-right and the camera (which is top-center). What you'll see when I'm looking at the corner is my eyes appearing to move back and forth, which is the AI processing.

7:14 ‚Äî Another segment where I am staring straight forward at the center of the screen and my eyes seem to keep shifting. There's about 30 seconds where I try to stay focused on roughly the spot between my eyes (just above the nose), so all the movement is again the AI algorithm.",24162,24,10,28,"Jarred Walton",532,45.4173,0.0451,0.0188,"Science & Technology",1,"Male","HAPPY","no","",29,0.111856538004188,0,"[]",0.165,990,"PT16M30S",-0.316,82,0

In the last episode of this STD series, I will share more about Herpes simplex virus. Are you aware that almost half of the world‚Äôs population has this virus? What are the symptoms and treatment for this condition?

This is an infection which is a very common condition that is caused by the herpes simplex virus that is very contagious and often spreads through human to human contact.

The herpes simplex virus family has 2 members : HSV1 and HSV2
HSV-1 is mainly transmitted through the oral to oral contact causing oral herpes , commonly known as cold sore and can also cause genital herpes too. 
HSV2 is a sexually transmitted infection that causes genital herpes. These are mild infections and are generally harmless but may lead to potentially fatal complications for newborns, pregnant women and those with weakened immune system.

HSV 1 is not technically a sexually transmitted infection. Transmission occur mainly via contact with the virus in sores, saliva or surfaces in and around the mouth. Most HSV 1 infections are acquired during childhood and not uncommonly from their parents.
 
Infected persons often experience first a tingling, itching or burning sensation around their mouth before the onset of painful sores or vesicles. The sores will resolve on their own usually within 7-10 days. But can recur periodically throughout our lives.

Other common symptoms of HSV 1 infections include fever with muscle aches, lymph nodes swelling and swollen red gums.

HSV 2 is mainly transmitted during sex through contact with genital or anal surfaces, skin, sores or fluids of someone infected with the virus. Genitalia herpes can be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms that can go
unrecognised. When symptoms do occur, one or more painful vesicles or ulcers may appear in the private area.
Herpes simplex virus infection is usually a clinical diagnosis made by the doctor. No tests is necessary.

Treatment objective for HSV infections are
1) to Reduce the severity of symptoms
2) Speed up the healing process
3) In patients with very frequent recurrence, to reduce the frequency

Unfortunately, HSV cannot be cured. Once you have it, the virus stays with you. Hence, to avoid spreading this virus to others
- those with active oral herpes should avoid oral contact with others and avoid sharing objects that touched saliva until symptoms have fully resolved.
- individuals with genital herpes should abstain from sex until symptoms have resolved fully too.

However, given the fact that HSV can be transmitted even when no symptoms are felt,
- avoiding promiscuous sexual activities and
- using condoms

Now I would like to highlight two important points about HSV infections, which is its relation with HIV and transmission of HIV from mother to child
during delivery.
HSV-2 infection increases the risk of acquiring HIV infection by approximately 3 fold. Additionally, people with both HIV and HSV-2 infection are more likely to spread HIV to others. Hence, it is recommended to screen for HIV infection when someone has been diagnosed with HSV-2.
In rare circumstances, Herpes simplex virus can be transmitted from mother to child during delivery, causing a condition called neonatal herpes.
It is rare but when it does occur, can lead to serious consequences such as death to baby, brain infection with permanent neurological disability to the infant and even eye infection with potential blindness.
Therefore, if you are pregnant and have symptoms of genital herpes, please inform your obstetrician right away.

I hope this episode has increased your knowledge to one of the most common viral infection in the world. Recognise its symptoms to prevent the spread to your loved ones.

We want flow in our swing, but we also want some form of structure that reduces variables. Whether that's the wrists, whether that's the arms, whether that's the rotation. We want simplicity, having less to think about when you just stand there and trust that you can hit a golf shot is only a good thing because too many swing thoughts, trying to place positions, you can't swing your way around a golf course. You have to react to the target. So we need a swing that is simpler.

Chip Shots are Much EASIER with this Technique
Are you looking to improve your golf game? One of the most important aspects of the game is chipping around the greens. 

In this video, I'm going to show you the best way to chip a golf ball around the green. 

There are two main ways to do this: the bump and run chip shot and the basic chip shot. And I display the easiest way to hit chip shots closer in various situations around the green using either an 8 iron or a wedge. I'll show you both methods and let you decide which one is best for you.

We also cover in this golf lesson why using an 8 iron to chip with might be better than using a 7 iron vs a wedge chipping technique. 

In this video, I offer golf tips that will help you chip with more confidence and get closer to the hole.

"All about Canada for Kids | Learn about this fun country's history and culture","Qo7aTFHyhPE","UCKCsVSA5THlkHbnkZTPm6-g","NOTE: We have been made aware of some issues in this video. We apologize for the mispronunciation of Newfoundland and M√©tis. The ""small groups"" of First Nations people and Inuit make up around 5% of the population, and their cultures are very important to the country. Additionally, the animals shown for wolves and beavers are incorrect. We apologize for these mistakes and hope you can still enjoy the video!

Have you ever been to the country just north of the United States of America? In All about Canada for Kids, you will learn lots of interesting facts about this cool neighbor of ours. For instance, Canada is the second-largest country in the world but is home to only about half of 1% of the world's total population! That's a lot of space for so few people.

Canada is made up of 10 provinces and 3 territories. Ottawa, Ontario, is the capitol city, and the largest city is Toronto, Ontario. The second-largest city in Canada is Montr√©al, Qu√©bec. It's a major seaport and one of the biggest French-speaking countries in the world. After all, both English and French are the two official languages of the country. Nearly half the people in Canada have British ancestors, and around one-fourth have French ancestors. There is also a small group of First Nations people and Inuit who live there.

Lots of different animals lives among the mountains, plains, forests, and lakes of Canada. Some of these include bears, beavers, moose, mountain lions, bison, antelope, caribou, foxes, owls, and even polar bears! There are 41 national parks and 3 conservation areas throughout the country. One of the most famous national parks in Canada is Banff National Park.

We hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the country of Canada! If you want even more information, head over to our website and download one of our many free lesson plans, full of activities, worksheets, and more!
